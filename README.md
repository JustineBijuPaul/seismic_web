# Seismic Web

## Overview

Seismic Web is a Flask-based web application designed to detect earthquakes from audio files. The application uses machine learning to analyze audio data and identify seismic events. It supports multiple file formats, including `.mp3`, `.wav`, and `.mseed`.

## Features

- Upload audio files for earthquake detection.
- Visualize waveform data using Chart.js.
- Download detected earthquake hit points as an `.mseed` file.
- Save waveform charts as PNG images.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Librosa
- Obspy
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib
- Pandas
- Axios (for frontend)
- Chart.js (for frontend)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/justinebijupaul/seismic_web.git
    cd seismic_web
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Train the model (if not already trained):

    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```

4. Run the Flask application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## File Structure

- `app.py`: The main Flask application file.
- `train_model.py`: Script to train the earthquake detection model.
- `upload.py`: HTML template for file upload and prediction.
- `uploads/`: Directory to store uploaded files temporarily.
- `earthquake_model.joblib`: Trained model file (generated by `train_model.py`).
- `earthquake_scaler.joblib`: Scaler file (generated by `train_model.py`).

## Usage

1. Upload an audio file (`.mp3`, `.wav`, or `.mseed`) using the file input form.
2. The application will process the file and display the prediction result.
3. If an earthquake is detected, the waveform chart will be displayed with hit points highlighted.
4. You can save the waveform chart as a PNG image by clicking the "Save Chart as PNG" button.
5. You can download the detected earthquake hit points as an `.mseed` file by clicking the "Download Hit Points as MSEED" button.
